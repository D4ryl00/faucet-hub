## Miscellaneous Provisions.

1. Binding Arbitration. These Terms provides that all disputes between you and us will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. ACCORDINGLY, YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT (INCLUDING IN A CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING) to assert or defend your rights under these Terms (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be
   determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. a. We and you agree that all disputes arising from or relating to NewTendermint or any relationship or dispute between you and us or you and any company or person employed by us, these Terms and any policies or practices of any of the
   above-mentioned companies or persons (a “Dispute”) will only be resolved subject to FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION as set forth in this section, and may only be resolved through an individual arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. You further agree that we shall not have a legal obligation to
   mitigate any of our potential or actual losses sustained hereunder. b. WE AND YOU GIVE UP OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT in connection with any Dispute and such rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. NEITHER WE NOR YOU SHALL BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
   DISPUTE. Neither we nor you agree to class arbitration or any other arbitration proceedings where a person brings a dispute as a representative of other persons. c. If we and you are unable to resolve a Dispute by informal means, the arbitration of that Dispute shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in
   San Francisco, California in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement must be brought in the District Court or in any state court of competent jurisdiction with venue lying in San Francisco, California to the exclusion of all other forums. d. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NewTendermint
   reserves the right to seek injunctive relief in a court of law to protect its rights and interests.
2. Governing Law. All Disputes will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California without reference to the choice of law provisions of any jurisdiction. The interpretation of these Terms shall not be construed against the drafter.
3. Assignment. You may not assign these Terms or your rights or obligations under these Terms without NewTendermint’s prior written permission. Any assignment in violation of this restriction is null and void. NewTendermint may assign these Terms in its sole discretion without giving any prior notice to you.
4. Force Majeure. Neither party shall be responsible for delays or failure in performance resulting from acts beyond the control of such party, including, without limitation, acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics, pandemics, fire, communication line failures, power surges or failures, earthquakes or other disasters.
5. Sole Agreement; Amendment; Waiver. These Terms constitutes the sole and complete agreement between the parties regarding NewTendermint. These Terms may not be explained or supplemented by a prior performance, trade usage, or course of dealing between the parties, or by any prior performance between the parties under these Terms or otherwise. No amendment
   to these Terms shall be effective unless it is in writing signed by duly authorized representatives of both parties, except that NewTendermint may amend these Terms from time to time, and your continued use of NewTendermint after receiving notification of such amendments constitutes your agreement to be bound by such amendments. No waiver of any breach of
   any provision by either party or the failure of either party to insist on the exact performance of any provision of these Terms shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of performance of the same or any other provisions, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing.
6. Severability. If any of the provisions of these Terms shall be or become invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining provisions of these Terms. Instead, this entire Agreement shall be construed as though not containing the particular invalid or unenforceable provision or
   provisions, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.
7. Survival. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of Terms, the following sections contained herein will survive the expiration termination of these Terms: NewTendermint Disclaimers, Limitation of Liabilities, Indemnity, Intellectual Property, and Consent to use Data.
